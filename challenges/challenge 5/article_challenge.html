    <h1>Sorry, Silicon Valley Won’t Save Your Kids From Tech Addiction</h1>

    <p>We asked hundreds of parents how they manage (and don’t manage) their kids’ screen time. The answers were candid, scary–and sometimes hopeful. </p>

    <p>“I am tethered to my smartphone for both work and entertainment, as is my husband. It’s omnipresent and an extension of our bodies.
      Not wanting to be left out, my 16-month-old son takes the baby monitor, holds it in his hands, and peers at it like it is a smartphone.
      It is the cutest/most pathetic thing.”</p>


    <p>That’s the eerie image a New York mom of two paints of her small child’s burgeoning tech addiction. Like most parents, that mom lives a
      waking life seeped in almost non-stop screen time (an average American adult spends about
      <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/30/health/americans-screen-time-nielsen/index.html" target="_blank">11 hours a day looking at a screen</a>).
      She, like many modern parents, sees her own tech dependency reflected in her children’s habits. She doesn’t always like what she sees.</p>

    <p>Even as we learn about the
      <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40520843/silicon-valley-technology-regulate-gadgets-and-apps-like-cigarettes" target="_blank">
        potential pitfalls</a> of our increasingly technology-addled lifestyles, our dependence on tech shows little
      sign of waning. Still, the anti-screen time drumbeat is getting louder, especially when it comes to kids.</p>

    <p>In November, Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early employee at Facebook,
       <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40506058/former-facebook-exec-social-media-is-ripping-apart-society"
        target="_blank">said that the social network was “ripping apart the social fabric of how society works.”</a>
        Tristan Harris, a former product manager at Google,
        <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/"
         target="_blank">  told Wired</a> that Apple, Google, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter,
        and Instagram design products to “hijack” our time and attention. In January, two Apple investors asked the company
        to study the health effects of its products on children.</p>

      <p>Then, last month, an unprecedented alliance of former employees from some the most powerful tech
          companies–including Apple, Google, and Facebook–formed the <a href="http://humanetech.com/"
          target="_blank">Center for Humane Technology.</a> In partnership with the nonprofit media watchdog group Common Sense Media, the group
         plans to lobby against addictive tech, and is kicking off with
         <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40526553/truth-about-tech-campaign-aims-to-pressure-tech-giants-to-make-less-addictive-products"

         How Our Tech Addiction–And Constant Distraction–Is A Solvable Design Problem</a></p>

        <hr>

        <p>That the very people who championed the technology to which we are addicted are now banding together to warn parents about the monster
          they’ve created is perhaps a sign that more people are starting to question tech’s outsized role in our lives.
          But it feels a bit farfetched that an ad campaign, no matter how well-intentioned, can really help curtail our
          society’s addiction–especially when kids these days are being introduced to screens at such a young age.
          In her book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Screen-Time-Balance-Digital/dp/1610396723" target="_blank">
            <i>The Art of Screen Time</i></a> Anya Kamenetz cited a 2011 survey of 9,000 preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds)
            that found that young kids spend about four hours a day in the company of (all types of) screens.</p>

        <p>To find out what parents think about their kids’ use of tech, <i>Fast Company</i> surveyed nearly 400 parents.
          We tried to look at the issue from all angles, from the amount of screen time kids get to have, to the types of devices
          kids use, to parents’ regrets about their kids use of technology, to the benefits that technology can provide to families.
          We also asked parents how they feel about witnessing their own tech addiction reflected in their kids’ behavior.
          Those were, perhaps, the most telling answers of all.</p>

        <p>The parents who answered our survey hail from all over the U.S. (and a few other countries). Their professions
          span many industries, including marketing, public relations, education, finance, therapy, video production,
          law, medicine, and business. Most participants have one or two children, ranging from 7 months to 18 years old.
          The majority of participants’ kids are between 3 and 11 years old; in other words, these parents are
          in the thick of parenting.</p>

        <p>Obviously, this self-selected group of <i>Fast Company</i> readers isn’t a conclusive sample–but, along with
          expert research, these parents’ insights help provide a snapshot of the worries that burden
          parents in our tech-dependent era.</p>

        <h3>Do Screens Make Kids Less Social And Less Creative?</h3>

        <p>Even if it involves lots of virtual interaction via social networks and texting, using a screen
          can be a pretty solo activity. Using smartphones, tablets, and even computers aren’t generally
          as communal as watching a TV with your family.</p>

          A Smarter Way To Think About “Screen Time” And Kids’ Tech Use</a></p>

        <hr>

        <p>TV has been around a long time. For many of us, it is the devil we know and, unlike
          other screened devices, it’s arguably easier for parents to know what their children are
           watching on TV than it is for parents to know what their kids are looking at on the internet.
           In fact, as crazy as it might sound, we’ve reached a point where some parents actually wish
           their kids were watching <i>more</i> TV.</p>

        <p>“I would love them to watch TV, at least it is more social since they will watch it with their
          siblings or friends! I never thought I would ever be encouraging this, but [watching TV] is
          much better than being locked in your own room with your own iPhone having an isolated life,”
          wrote a London dad of three.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, many of our readers told us that they feel that tech has
          squashed their kids’ creativity–and turned them into little monsters.</p>

        <p>“I purchased a tablet for my oldest child at the age of 9. She stopped using her imagination,
          she very abruptly stopped drawing, and very quickly it became a daily battle to limit her time
          on the tablet,” wrote an environmental biologist from Pennsylvania who has three kids.</p>

        <p>A dad and executive from Chicago, also with three kids, interprets it this way: “[The]
          smartphone takes over a child’s daily consciousness. Natural[ly] voracious, inquisitive
          curiosity seekers slowly, invariably, and inevitably become young people indifferent to discovery
          in favor of scrolling. Smartphones numb creativity, intellectual critical thought, and social growth.”</p>

        <h3>Being A Role Model Is Scary</h3>

        <p>A lot of parenting can be a battle of “do what I say, not what I do”–and nowhere is this more
          evident than in parents’ use of tech. Many parents in our survey said their device dependency
          makes them feel like hypocrites when they try to limit their kids’ tech use. “My main regret
          is how much we use phones in front of them,” wrote a mom of two from Minnesota who doesn’t
          allow any screen time for her two young children.</p>

        <p>“I see myself reaching for my phone out of habit anytime I’m the least bit bored
          or have a moment to spare. I hate this, and yet can’t seem to stop myself. I figure
          at least my brain patterns were formed without this influence and am terrified of what
          growing up with smartphones and tech will do to my daughter,” wrote a New York City
          mom of a 1-year-old.</p>

        <p>When kids get older, they relish calling their parents out on that hypocrisy. “Some apps
          and games can become a part of your life and routines to the point where they become an
          obsession. My kids call me out for being on my phone too much, and I have to pull myself
          out of it and show them how you can set limits with yourself and be present with the people
          in your life,” wrote a psychologist and New York mom of three.</p>

        <p>“I asked my kids what they thought about smartphones. They said that they must be really
           important, because the adults looked at their screens all the time, and based on how frustrated
           adults got when kids interrupted them, they assumed the phones were more important than them,
           which was heartbreakingly sad to hear,” wrote an engineer and mom of two from New Hampshire. </p>

        <p>Many parents who answered our survey said that having kids forced them to look more
          critically at how they use technology and caused these parents to make a conscious
          effort to change. “My wife and I have now made a pledge for complete ‘phone-free’
          activity for ourselves from the time we arrive home from work until the children go
          to bed–no scrolling social media, no email checking,” wrote a Chicago dad of three.</p>

        <h3>Parents Are Worried About Addiction</h3>

        <p>With a lack of solid national data on the effects of all this tech exposure on kids,
           parents definitely have a lot of concerns. In our unscientific survey, only a blissed
           out 1% of parents expressed no concerns about their kids’ use of tech.</p>

        <p>For the rest of our participants, nearly everyone (over 80%) communicated concern about their kids
          becoming addicted and developing a shortened attention span (likely because the parents are
          experiencing these problems themselves). In our survey, addiction appears to trump the traditional
           things we were told to fear on the internet, like sexual predators and online bullying, which
           only concerned about half of parents who took part in our survey. And data privacy is only a
            concern for a little more than half of parents who took part in our questionnaire.</p>

        <p>“It’s definitely addictive behavior. And behavioral change is real. Wonder what damage was done during
          a more permissive period that we can’t now undo,” wrote a mom of two from Massachusetts of kids’ device habits.</p>

        <p>A New York mom of two describes the compulsive behavior she witnesses in her daughter. “Monitoring screen
          time is exhausting and virtually impossible. My 12-year-old daughter checks her phone constantly;
          she doesn’t even know she’s doing it.”</p>

          Why Your Free Time Probably Shouldn’t Be Screen Time</a> </p>

        <hr>

        <p>These parents’ concerns are backed up by research. A
          <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/about-us/news/press-releases/new-report-finds-teens-feel-addicted-to-their-phones-causing-tension-at"
            target="_blank">  2016 survey from Common Sense Media </a>
          found that 78% of teenagers check their devices at least hourly, and half said that they
          thought they were addicted to their phones. There is a lot of debate, however, over whether
          it is possible to truly be addicted, in the clinical sense, to technology.</p>

        <p>[Photo: Flickr user <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rafiqs/15754228983" target="_blank">Rafiq Sarlie</a> ]</p>

        <p>Some experts like Nicholas Kardaras, PhD, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glow-Kids-Screen-Addiction-Hijacking/dp/1250097991"
            target="_blank"> <i>Glow Kids: How Screen Addiction Is Hijacking Our Kids</i></a>,
          believe categorically that the behavior some kids and adults exhibit falls into the realm of
          addictive behavior. In an interview for NPR with Kamenetz, he points to brain-imaging studies
          that show the effects of screen time, and points to the many teens he has treated who get so
          wrapped up in video games that they don’t even get up to use the bathroom. To hear Kardaras
          tell it, the evidence of technology’s addictive nature is obvious.</p>

        <p>Kamenetz and Ana Homayoun, author of <a href="http://www.anahomayoun.com/books/">
           <i>Social Media Wellness: Helping Teens and Tweens Thrive in an Unbalanced Digital World
        </i></a>, take a more cautious stance. Homayoun calls it “problematic overuse.” “I think that covers a broader range
        of situations that you can deal with earlier,” she explains. “Tech doesn’t have the same impact as something like
        opioids.” She says that the signs of problematic overuse are similar to the traditional signs of addiction, like
        withdrawing from friends and activities or becoming angry or violent when the phone is take away.</p>

        <p>Her solution? A digital detox: a family vacation over a long weekend to a place without Wi-Fi.
          “It helps them get over the hump, and they come back with a different relationship to it.
          They have to get through that initial anxiety and through the other side.”</p>

        <h3>What About School?</h3>

        <p>A constant refrain in our survey was how the near total saturation of tech in schools made
          the entire idea of “screen time” much more nebulous. After all, many schools (especially
          in more affluent districts) have introduced a one-to-one program for kids with tablets or
          Chromebooks, some starting in elementary school. Kamenetz points to research that has shown
          that kids actually learn better in classrooms where two or three kids have to share each
          device because that forces them to collaborate.</p>

          <hr>

        <p>Related: <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40417817/can-techie-parents-reinvent-school-for-everyone-or-just-their-rich-kids"
            target="_blank">
          Can Techie Parents Reinvent School For Everyone–Or Just Their Rich Kids?</a></p>

        <hr>

        <p>But regardless of kids’ use of tech in the classroom, nearly all kids are required to check or complete
          their homework online, which means that they will spend some of their time at home online. Several parents
          in our survey feel like this means that putting limits on screen time is out of their hands. “When the
          schools provided them with personal Chromebooks, it become impossible to monitor or regulate what they
          were doing online,” wrote a Minnesota dad of two.</p>

        <p>“I think schools have generally done a poor job of educating parents on tech-related topics, and many
          parents aren’t aware of tools and strategies that they can employ to give their kids some structure
          when using tech,” wrote an Illinois mom of two teens. Homayoun agrees with some of those concerns.
          She says that in many cases, schools rush to put technology in place without thinking about how it
          might impact kids.</p>

        <p>The way Homayoun sees it, the big missing skill is time management. “The same tool that they need to use to
          complete their work is the same thing that’s distracting them from getting work done,” she says of
          these digital devices. Homayoun delivers school orientation programs to teach parents, teachers,
          and students how to self-regulate and stay motivated. She believes that setting limits on how long
           kids can be on devices, even if they are using them to do homework, helps kids stay on task.
           <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/section/time-management" target="_blank">Time management</a>  and distraction are
           issues that adults deal with daily–both at work and in their personal lives. So Homayoun urges parents to
           approach their kids’ struggles with device management from a place of empathy.</p>

        <h3>Time management</h3>

        <p>Most of the parents who answered our survey don’t use parental controls on all the devices that
          their kids use. Sometimes this led to frightening results, as one parent wrote: “I wish I was
          more ahead of the game on knowing how to block certain sites. My sweet innocent daughter was
          accidentally exposed to soft-core porn when looking for Barbie princess videos online.”</p>

        <p>Parents might be skipping out of the parental controls because they don’t trust them. As Homayoun
          points out, “Kids are smart and can find ways around them.” She advises that rather than blocking
          or banning certain sites or apps, parents should work to understand what their kids are using and
          have a conversation with their children about their goals in visiting the sites.</p>

        <p>That said, Homayoun recalls that many of the teens she works with confess that they actually wish their
          parents would put more limits on their tech use by doing things like not allowing them to use their
          phones in their bedrooms at night (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40427741/you-might-not-feel-tired-but-your-brain-needs-more-sleep"
          target="_blank">something adults should also be doing to get more sleep</a>).</p>

        <h3>Realistic Limits And Expectations</h3>

        <p>If there is one overarching theme to our survey and all of the current research around
          kids’ use of tech, it’s this: We still don’t know.</p>

        <p>Victor Strasburger, coauthor of the
          <a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/american-academy-of-pediatrics-announces-new-recommendations-for-childrens-media-use.aspx"
          target="_blank">American Academy of Pediatrics’ guidelines for children’s use of
          media and technology</a> , admitted to Kamenetz that because of the lack of research, “We have no good
          idea about what the media diet should be if you include computer time, smartphones, iPads, that sort
          of thing. Maybe it’s four or five hours a day. Maybe computer time for homework shouldn’t count, or does count. We simply don’t know.”</p>

        <p>And that’s really the bottom line to this thorny conversation. Technology has changed so
          rapidly in just the last 15 years, let alone since the time today’s parents were kids
          themselves. Screen time often feels like the new sugar: We fear it’s rotting our kids’
          insides. And while it’s true that we need more research to really understand how screen
          time is affecting kids’ brains, Kamenetz asserts that tech isn’t an unknown toxin doing
          invisible damage to kids. She believes that the negative effects of technology are things
           parents can see, and that parents can apply common sense in order to figure out how to mitigate the problems.</p>

        <p>Like most things in life, the solution might just be moderation. It may seem like we are at
          a point of no return, but some families are finding their way back, like this designer from
          Seattle who is a dad of four. He wrote of his family, “For years, we were undisciplined [about]
          screen usage. They were more tired, more moody, and generally less willing to engage in normal
          childhood play. Now that we have seen those effects and pulled the screens away, they are more
          engaged with each other, with us, their imagination has come back dramatically, and the more
          analog life has also become exciting again.”</p>

        <p>This is the approach Kamenetz recommends in her book. She says, “We don’t have a set of solidly
          evidence-based recommendations that say, ‘Healthy screen time looks like this.’ But I’ve come up
           with my own take on Michael Pollen’s famous maxim: “Enjoy screens. Not too much. Mostly with others.”</p>

        <p>And like any other behavior parents hope to impress on their kids (manners, healthy eating habits,
           volunteering), parents’ actions make a much bigger impact than their words.</p>

          target="_blank">ND Strupler</a>]</p>

        <h3>The Upside</h3>

        <p>Of course, not all tech use falls into the mindless games and social media camp. As many parents
          pointed out, aptitude with technology is a crucial skill for kids to succeed in school and in later careers.</p>

        <p>To that end, some of the parents helped get their kids excited about being engaged with
          tech by sharing what they were doing when they were staring at a screen. “I think her
          interest in technology stems from me working with technology so closely. I’m always on my
          phone or computer. I make it a point to explain what I am doing on the phone or computer,
          and allow her to ask questions,” wrote a Palo Alto-based brand marketer and dad of a 5-year-old.</p>

        <p>“The need to understand how to use technology and navigate the tech world–this is not going away.
          It’s how they are learning in school and it’s the workforce they’ll one day join. We are pushing
          STEM on our kids, yet we freak out about them using technology and how it’s ruining their
          childhood,” pointed out a Kansas City PR manager and mom of two.</p>

        <p>The bulk of the conversations around kids and tech is about the dangers of addiction, shortened
          attention spans, privacy, online bullying, depression, and lack of empathy. But the saturation
          of technology in kids’ lives is helping them in ways that weren’t possible a generation ago. Look
           no further than the Parkland, Florida, teenagers who are using their social media savvy to force
            a national conversation about gun control.</p>

        <p>The parents in our survey pointed to many other tangible benefits. “My children can watch videos
          and listen to music from anywhere in the world, listen to experts talk about their given fields,
          learn how to code, learn another language, the list goes on. None of that was available to me as a
          child. My mom’s encyclopedia set was all I had. Australia was a 4-by-6-inch black and white picture
           in a book. The other day, my children Skyped with my brother who now lives there, and they took a
            tour of Sydney, all from their phones,” explained a Mississippi mom of four. “When used the right
             way, technology can bridge gaps to provide information to anyone, regardless of demographics.”</p>

        <p>I’m at the beginning of my parenting life. My son isn’t even 2 years old. Who knows what tech we’ll be worried
           about by the time he’s in high school, or what his concerns will be when he becomes a parent. Like the
            parents in our survey, my plan is to give him the tools he’ll need to succeed, and teach him the
             best way to use them. And for now, I make sure that I save my email checking for after he goes to bed.</p>
