<h3>"They have no</h3>

<p>leader," said Bagheera. "They lie. They have always lied." </p>

<p>"They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken among the Monkey People? They
    stand on their feet as I do. They do not hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up!
    Bad Baloo, let me up! I will play with them again." </p>

<p>"Listen, man-cub," said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on a hot night. "I have taught thee
    all the Law of the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.
    They have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own, but use the stolen words which they
    overhear when they listen, and peep, and wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are
    without leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people
    about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is
    forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not drink where the monkeys drink; we do not
    go where the monkeys go; we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever heard
    me speak of the Bandar-log till today?" </p>

<p>"No," said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo had finished.</p>

<p>"The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds. They are very many, evil, dirty,
    shameless, and they desire, if they have any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not
    notice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads." </p>

<h3>He had hardly</h3>

<p>spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down through the branches; and they could hear coughings
    and howlings and angry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches. </p>

<p>"The Monkey-People are forbidden," said Baloo, "forbidden to the Jungle-People. Remember." </p>

<p>"Forbidden," said Bagheera, "but I still think Baloo should have warned thee against them." </p>

<p>"I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey People! Faugh!" </p>

<p>A fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking Mowgli with them. What Baloo had
    said about the monkeys was perfectly true. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look up,
    there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross each other's path. But whenever they
    found a sick wolf, or a wounded tiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks and
    nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then they would howl and shriek senseless
    songs, and invite the Jungle-People to climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles
    over nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the Jungle-People could see them. They were
    always just going to have a leader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because their
    memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they compromised things by making up a saying, "What
    the Bandar-log think now the jungle will think later," and that comforted them a great deal. None of the
    beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts would notice them, and that was why they
    were so pleased when Mowgli came to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was. </p>

<h3>They never meant</h3>

<p>to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at all; but one of them invented what seemed to him a
    brilliant idea, and he told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in the tribe, because
    he could weave sticks together for protection from the wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him
    teach them. Of course Mowgli, as a woodcutter's child, inherited all sorts of instincts, and used to make
    little huts of fallen branches without thinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the
    trees, considered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were really going to have a leader
    and become the wisest people in the jungle --so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them.
    Therefore they followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very quietly till it was time for
    the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was very much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,
    resolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.</p>

<p>The next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and arms--hard, strong, little hands--and then
    a swash of branches in his face, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo woke the
    jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk with every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled
    with triumph and scuffled away to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting: "He has
    noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People admire us for our skill and our cunning." Then
    they began their flight; and the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of the things nobody
    can describe. They have their regular roads and crossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty
    to seventy or a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at night if necessary. Two of
    the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under the arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet
    at a bound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the boy's weight held them back.
    Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not help enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down
    below frightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing over nothing but empty air
    brought his heart between his teeth. His escort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost
    branches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop would fling themselves into the air
    outward and downward, and bring up, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next
    tree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green jungle, as a man on the top of a
    mast can see for miles across the sea, and then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face,
    and he and his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and crashing and whooping and
    yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept along the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.</p>

<p>For a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew better than to struggle, and then
    he began to think. The first thing was to send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys
    were going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless to look down, for he could only see
    the topsides of the branches, so he stared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing and
    wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die. Rann saw that the monkeys were carrying
    something, and dropped a few hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He whistled with
    surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop and heard him give the Kite call for--"We be of one
    blood, thou and I." The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Chil balanced away to the next tree
    in time to see the little brown face come up again. "Mark my trail!" Mowgli shouted. "Tell Baloo of the
    Seeonee Pack and Bagheera of the Council Rock."</p>

<p>"In whose name, Brother?" Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of course he had heard of him.</p>

<p>"Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my tra-il!"</p>

<h3>The last words</h3>

<p>were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but Rann nodded and rose up till he
    looked no bigger than a speck of dust, and there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of
    the treetops as Mowgli's escort whirled along. </p>

<p>"They never go far," he said with a chuckle. "They never do what they set out to do. Always pecking at new
    things are the Bandar-log. This time, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for themselves,
    for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill more than goats." </p>

<p>So he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.</p>

<p>Meantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera climbed as he had never climbed
    before, but the thin branches broke beneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark. </p>

<p>"Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?" he roared to poor Baloo, who had set off at a clumsy trot in the
    hope of overtaking the monkeys. "What was the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn
    him?" </p>

<h3>"Haste! O haste!</h3>

<p>We--we may catch them yet!" Baloo panted.</p>

<p>"At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the Law--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to
    and fro would burst thee open. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing. They may drop
    him if we follow too close." </p>

<p>"Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him already, being tired of carrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log?
    Put dead bats on my head! Give me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees that I may be
    stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most miserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli,
    Mowgli! Why did I not warn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now perhaps I may have
    knocked the day's lesson out of his mind, and he will be alone in the jungle without the Master Words."</p>

<p>Baloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.</p>

<p>"At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago," said Bagheera impatiently. "Baloo, thou
    hast neither memory nor respect. What would the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like
    Ikki the Porcupine, and howled?"</p>

<h3>"What do I</h3>

<p>care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now."</p>

<p>"Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him out of idleness, I have no fear for
    the man-cub. He is wise and well taught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People afraid.
    But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the Bandar-log, and they, because they live in trees,
    have no fear of any of our people." Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am," said Baloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk,
    "it is true what Hathi the Wild Elephant says: `To each his own fear'; and they, the Bandar-log, fear Kaa
    the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the young monkeys in the night. The whisper of
    his name makes their wicked tails cold. Let us go to Kaa."</p>

<p>"What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and with most evil eyes," said Bagheera.</p>

<p>"He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry," said Baloo hopefully. "Promise him many
    goats."</p>

<h3>"He sleeps for</h3>

<p>a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep now, and even were he awake what if he would rather
    kill his own goats?" Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.</p>

<p>"Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see reason." Here Baloo rubbed his
    faded brown shoulder against the Panther, and they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.</p>

<p>They found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun, admiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement for the last ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting his big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet of his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he thought of his dinner to come.</p>

<p>"He has not eaten," said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as he saw the beautifully mottled brown
    and yellow jacket. "Be careful, Bagheera! He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and
    very quick to strike."</p>

<p>Kaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes as cowards--but his strength
    lay in his hug, and when he had once lapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said.
    "Good hunting!" cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of his breed Kaa was rather deaf,
    and did not hear the call at first. Then he curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.</p>

<h3>"Good hunting for</h3>

<p>us all," he answered. "Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do here? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs
  food. Is there any news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty as a dried well."</p>

<p>"We are hunting," said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry Kaa. He is too big.</p>

<p>"Give me permission to come with you," said Kaa. "A blow more or less is nothing to thee, Bagheera or
    Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for days in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance
    of a young ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young. Rotten twigs and dry
    boughs are they all."</p>

<p>"Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter," said Baloo.</p>

<p>"I am a fair length--a fair length," said Kaa with a little pride. "But for all that, it is the fault
    of this new-grown timber. I came very near to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise
    of my slipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the Bandar-log, and they called
    me most evil names."</p>

<h3>"Footless, yellow earth-worm,"</h3>

<p>said Bagheera under his whiskers, as though he were trying to remember something.</p>

<p>"Sssss! Have they ever called me that?" said Kaa.</p>

<p>"Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we never noticed them. They will
    say anything--even that thou hast lost all thy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because
    (they are indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the he-goat's horns," Bagheera
    went on sweetly.</p>

<p>Now a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows that he is angry, but Baloo and
    Bagheera could see the big swallowing muscles on either side of Kaa's throat ripple and bulge.</p>

<p>"The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds," he said quietly. "When I came up into the sun today I heard
    them whooping among the tree-tops."</p>

<h3>"It--it is</h3>

<p>the Bandar-log that we follow now," said Baloo, but the words stuck in his throat, for that was the first
    time in his memory that one of the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the
    monkeys.</p>

<p>"Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such hunters--leaders in their own jungle I am
    certain--on the trail of the Bandar-log," Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.</p>

<p>"Indeed," Baloo began, "I am no more than the old and sometimes very foolish Teacher of the Law to the
  Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera here--"</p>

<p>"Is Bagheera," said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap, for he did not believe in being
  humble. "The trouble is this, Kaa. Those nut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our
  man-cub of whom thou hast perhaps heard."</p>

<p>"I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a man-thing that was entered into a
  wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki is full of stories half heard and very badly told."</p>

<h3>"But it is true.</h3>

<p>He is such a man-cub as never was," said Baloo. "The best and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil,
  who shall make the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides, I--we--love him, Kaa."</p>

<p>"Ts! Ts!" said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. "I also have known what love is. There are tales I could
  tell that--"</p>

<p>"That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly," said Bagheera quickly. "Our man-cub
  is in the hands of the Bandar-log now, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone."</p>

<p>"They fear me alone. They have good reason," said Kaa. "Chattering, foolish, vain--vain, foolish, and
  chattering, are the monkeys. But a man-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the
  nuts they pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning to do great things with it,
  and then they snap it in two. That man-thing is not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish' was
  it not?"</p>

<p>"Worm--worm--earth-worm," said Bagheera, "as well as other things which I cannot
  now say for shame."</p>

<h3>"We must remind</h3>

<p>"We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must help their wandering memories.
  Now, whither went they with the cub?"</p>

<p>"The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe," said Baloo. "We had thought that thou wouldst
  know, Kaa."</p>

<p>"I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the Bandar-log, or frogs--or green scum
  on a water-hole, for that matter."</p>

<p>"Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf Pack!"</p>

<p>Baloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the Kite, sweeping down with the sun
  shining on the upturned flanges of his wings. It was near Rann's bedtime, but he had ranged all over the
  jungle looking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.</p>

<h3>"What is it?"</h3>

<p>said Baloo. </p>

<p>"I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I watched. The Bandar-log have taken him
  beyond the river to the monkey city--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights, or
  an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is my message. Good hunting, all you
  below!"</p>

<p>"Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann," cried Bagheera. "I will remember thee in my next kill, and
  put aside the head for thee alone, O best of kites!"</p>

<p>"It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could have done no less," and Rann
  circled up again to his roost.</p>

<p>"He has not forgotten to use his tongue," said Baloo with a chuckle of pride. "To think of one so young
  remembering the Master Word for the birds too while he was being pulled across trees!"</p>

<h3>"It was most</h3>

<p>firmly driven into him," said Bagheera. "But I am proud of him, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs."</p>

<p>They all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever went there, because what they
  called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a
  place that men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not. Besides, the monkeys
  lived there as much as they could be said to live anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within
  eyeshot of it except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs held a little water.</p>

<p>"It is half a night's journey--at full speed," said Bagheera, and Baloo looked very serious. "I will go as
  fast as I can," he said anxiously.</p>

<p>"We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the quick-foot--Kaa and I."</p>

<p>"Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four," said Kaa shortly. Baloo made one effort to hurry,
  but had to sit down panting, and so they left him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the
  quick panther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the huge Rock-python held level with
  him. When they came to a hill stream, Bagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head
  and two feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up the distance.</p>

<h3>"By the Broken</h3>

<p>Lock that freed me," said Bagheera, when twilight had fallen, "thou art no slow goer!"</p>

<p>"I am hungry," said Kaa. "Besides, they called me speckled frog."</p>

<p>"Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot."</p>

<p>"All one. Let us go on," and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the ground, finding the shortest road with
  his steady eyes, and keeping to it.</p>

<p>In the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli's friends at all. They had brought the boy
  to the Lost City, and were very much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an Indian
  city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed very wonderful and splendid. Some king
  had built it long ago on a little hill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the ruined
  gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted hinges. Trees had grown into and out of the
  walls; the battlements were tumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of the towers
  on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.</p>

<h3>A great roofless</h3>

<p>palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the courtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red
  and green, and the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king's elephants used to live had been thrust
  up and apart by grasses and young trees. From the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses
  that made up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness; the shapeless block of stone that
  had been an idol in the square where four roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public
  wells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs sprouting on their sides. The monkeys
  called the place their city, and pretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.
  And yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to use them. They would sit in circles on
  the hall of the king's council chamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run in
  and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old bricks in a corner, and forget where
  they had hidden them, and fight and cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the
  terraces of the king's garden, where they would shake the rose trees and the oranges in sport to see the
  fruit and flowers fall. They explored all the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of
  little dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what they had not; and so drifted
  about in ones and twos or crowds telling each other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the
  tanks and made the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they would all rush together
  in mobs and shout: "There is no one in the jungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as
  the Bandar-log." Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city and went back to the
  tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice them.</p>

<p>Mowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like or understand this kind of life.
  The monkeys dragged him into the Cold Lairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli
  would have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about and sang their foolish songs.
  One of the monkeys made a speech and told his companions that Mowgli's capture marked a new thing in the
  history of the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks and canes together as a
  protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked up some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the
  monkeys tried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began to pull their friends' tails
  or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.</p>

<p>"I wish to eat," said Mowgli. "I am a stranger in this part of the jungle. Bring me food, or give me leave
  to hunt here."</p>

<p>Twenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild pawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the
  road, and it was too much trouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and angry as
  well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the Strangers' Hunting Call from time to time,
  but no one answered him, and Mowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. "All that Baloo has
  said about the Bandar-log is true," he thought to himself. "They have no Law, no Hunting Call, and no
  leaders--nothing but foolish words and little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,
  it will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle. Baloo will surely beat me, but that
  is better than chasing silly rose leaves with the Bandar-log."</p>

<p>No sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him back, telling him that he did not know
  how happy he was, and pinching him to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but went with
  the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone reservoirs that were half-full of rain water.
  There was a ruined summer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for queens dead a
  hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and blocked up the underground passage from the palace
  by which the queens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble tracery--beautiful
  milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians and jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up
  behind the hill it shone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black velvet embroidery.
  Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not help laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a
  time, to tell him how great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he was to wish to
  leave them. "We are great. We are free. We are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the
  jungle! We all say so, and so it must be true," they shouted. "Now as you are a new listener and can
  carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us in future, we will tell you all
  about our most excellent selves." Mowgli made no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and
  hundreds on the terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the Bandar-log, and
  whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would all shout together: "This is true; we all
  say so." Mowgli nodded and blinked, and said "Yes" when they asked him a question, and his head spun
  with the noise. "Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these people," he said to himself, "and now
  they have madness. Certainly this is dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a
  cloud coming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might try to run away in the
  darkness. But I am tired."</p>

<h3>That same cloud</h3>

<p>was being watched by two good friends in the ruined ditch below the city wall, for
  Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how dangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to
  run any risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and few in the jungle care for
  those odds.</p>

<p>"I will go to the west wall," Kaa whispered, "and come down swiftly with the slope of the ground in my
  favor. They will not throw themselves upon my back in their hundreds, but--"</p>

<p>"I know it," said Bagheera. "Would that Baloo were here, but we must do what we can. When that cloud covers
    the moon I shall go to the terrace. They hold some sort of council there over the boy."</p>

<p>"Good hunting," said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That happened to be the least ruined
  of any, and the big snake was delayed awhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the
  moon, and as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera's light feet on the terrace. The Black
  Panther had raced up the slope almost without a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time
  in biting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli in circles fifty and sixty deep.
  There was a howl of fright and rage, and then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath
  him, a monkey shouted: "There is only one here! Kill him! Kill." A scuffling mass of monkeys, biting,
  scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over Bagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him
  up the wall of the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome. A man-trained boy would
  have been badly bruised, for the fall was a good fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to
  fall, and landed on his feet.</p>

<p>"Stay there," shouted the monkeys, "till we have killed thy friends, and later we will play with thee--if
  the Poison-People leave thee alive."</p>

<h3>"We be of</h3>

<p>one blood, ye and I," said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake's Call. He could hear rustling
  and hissing in the rubbish all round him and gave the Call a second time, to make sure.</p>

<p>"Even ssso! Down hoods all!" said half a dozen low voices (every ruin in India becomes sooner or later
  a dwelling place of snakes, and the old summerhouse was alive with cobras). "Stand still, Little Brother,
  for thy feet may do us harm."</p>

<p>Mowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and listening to the furious din of
  the fight round the Black Panther--the yells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera's deep, hoarse
  cough as he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his enemies. For the first time
  since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for his life.</p>

<p>"Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone," Mowgli thought. And then he called aloud:
  "To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the water tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!"</p>

<p>Bagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new courage. He worked his way
  desperately, inch by inch, straight for the reservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall
  nearest the jungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done his best, but he could
  not come before. "Bagheera," he shouted, "I am here. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my
  feet! Wait my coming, O most infamous Bandar-log!" He panted up the terrace only to disappear to the head
  in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself squarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws,
  hugged as many as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat, like the flipping
  strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told Mowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank
  where the monkeys could not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just out of the water,
  while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps, dancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon
  him from all sides if he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his dripping chin,
  and in despair gave the Snake's Call for protection--"We be of one blood, ye and I"-- for he believed that
  Kaa had turned tail at the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on the edge of the
  terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black Panther asking for help.</p>

<h3>Kaa had only</h3>

<p>just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a wrench that dislodged a coping stone into the
  ditch. He had no intention of losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself once
  or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in working order. All that while the fight
  with Baloo went on, and the monkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to and
  fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even Hathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted,
  and, far away, scattered bands of the Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help
  their comrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the day birds for miles round.
  Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious to kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving
  blow of his head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can imagine a lance, or a
  battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half a ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle
  of it, you can roughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five feet long can
  knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and Kaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His
  first stroke was delivered into the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut mouth
  in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys scattered with cries of--"Kaa! It is Kaa!
  Run! Run!"</p>

<p>Generations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories their elders told them of Kaa,
  the night thief, who could slip along the branches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest
  monkey that ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead branch or a rotten stump
  that the wisest were deceived, till the branch caught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in
  the jungle, for none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look him in the face, and
  \none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so they ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the
  roofs of the houses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His fur was much thicker than Bagheera's,
  but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa opened his mouth for the first time and spoke one
  long hissing word, and the far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed where
  they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled under them. The monkeys on the walls and
  the empty houses stopped their cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard Bagheera
  shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank. Then the clamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped
  higher up the walls. They clung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they skipped
  along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse, put his eye to the screenwork and
  hooted owl-fashion between his front teeth, to show his derision and contempt.</p>

<p>"Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more," Bagheera gasped. "Let us take the man-cub and go.
    They may attack again."</p>

<p>"They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!" Kaa hissed, and the city was silent once more.
    "I could not come before, Brother, but I think I heard thee call"--this was to Bagheera.</p>

<p>"I--I may have cried out in the battle," Bagheera answered. "Baloo, art thou hurt?</p>

<h3>"I am not</h3>

<p>sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little bearlings," said Baloo, gravely shaking
    one leg after the other. "Wow! I am sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I."</p>

<p>"No matter. Where is the manling?"</p>

<p>"Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out," cried Mowgli. The curve of the broken dome was above
    his head.</p>

<p>"Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our young," said the
    cobras inside.</p>

<p>"Hah!" said Kaa with a chuckle, "he has friends everywhere, this manling. Stand back, manling.
    And hide you, O Poison People. I break down the wall."</p>

<h3>Kaa looked carefully</h3>

<p>till he found a discolored crack in the marble tracery showing a weak spot, made two
  or three light taps with his head to get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear of
  the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows, nose-first. The screen-work broke and fell
  away in a cloud of dust and rubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
  Baloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.</p>

<p>"Art thou hurt?" said Baloo, hugging him softly.</p>

<p>"I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled ye grievously, my Brothers!
    Ye bleed."</p>

<p>"Others also," said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the monkey-dead on the terrace and round
  the tank.</p>

<p>"It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all little frogs!"
    whimpered Baloo.</p>

<h3>"Of that we</h3>

<p>shall judge later," said Bagheera, in a dry voice that Mowgli did not at all like. "But here is Kaa
  to whom we owe the battle and thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli."</p>

<p>Mowgli turned and saw the great Python's head swaying a foot above his own.</p>

<p>"So this is the manling," said Kaa. "Very soft is his skin, and he is not unlike the Bandar-log.
  Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake thee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed
  my coat."</p>

<p>"We be one blood, thou and I," Mowgli answered. "I take my life from thee tonight. My kill shall be
    thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa."</p>

<p>"All thanks, Little Brother," said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. "And what may so bold a hunter
    kill? I ask that I may follow when next he goes abroad."</p>

<h3>"I kill nothing,--</h3>

<p>I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can use them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I
  speak the truth. I have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art in a trap, I may pay
  the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to Baloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters."</p>

<p>"Well said," growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very prettily. The Python dropped his head lightly
  for a minute on Mowgli's shoulder. "A brave heart and a courteous tongue," said he. "They shall carry thee far
  through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly with thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what
  follows it is not well that thou shouldst see."</p>

<p>The moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys huddled together on the walls and
  battlements looked like ragged shaky fringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera
  began to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the terrace and brought his jaws together
  with a ringing snap that drew all the monkeys' eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"The moon sets," he said. "Is there yet light enough to see?"</p>

<p>From the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops-- "We see, O Kaa."</p>

<h3>"Good. Begins now</h3>

<p>the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still and watch."</p>

<p>He turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right to left. Then he began making loops and
  figures of eight with his body, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided figures, and
  coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never stopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker,
  till at last the dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle of the scales.</p>

<p>Baloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats, their neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched
  and wondered.</p>

<p>"Bandar-log," said the voice of Kaa at last, "can ye stir foot or hand without my order? Speak!"</p>

<p>"Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!"</p>

<h3>"Good! Come all</h3>

<p>one pace nearer to me."</p>

<p>The lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and Bagheera took one stiff
  step forward with them.</p>

<p>"Nearer!" hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.</p>

<p>Mowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the two great beasts started as though
  they had been waked from a dream.</p>

<p>"Keep thy hand on my shoulder," Bagheera whispered. "Keep it there, or I must go back--must
    go back to Kaa. Aah!"</p>

<h3>"It is only</h3>

<p>old Kaa making circles on the dust," said Mowgli. "Let us go." And the three slipped off through a gap in the
  walls to the jungle.</p>

<p>"Whoof!" said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. "Never more will I make an ally of Kaa,"
    and he shook himself all over.</p>

<p>"He knows more than we," said Bagheera, trembling. "In a little time, had I stayed, I
    should have walked down his throat."</p>

<p>"Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again," said Baloo. "He will have
    good hunting--after his own fashion."</p>

<p>"But what was the meaning of it all?" said Mowgli, who did not know anything of a python's powers of fascination.
    "I saw no more than a big snake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all sore. Ho! Ho!"</p>

<h3>"Mowgli," said Bagheera</h3>

<p>angrily, "his nose was sore on thy account, as my ears and sides and paws, and Baloo's neck and shoulders are
  bitten on thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with pleasure for many days."</p>

<p>"It is nothing," said Baloo; "we have the man-cub again."</p>

<p>"True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in good hunting, in wounds, in hair--I
  am half plucked along my back--and last of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black Panther,
  was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I were both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger
  Dance. All this, man-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log."</p>

<p>"True, it is true," said Mowgli sorrowfully. "I am an evil man-cub, and my stomach is sad in me."</p>

<p>"Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?"</p>

<h3>Baloo did not</h3>

<p>wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could not tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: "Sorrow never stays punishment. But remember,
  Bagheera, he is very little."</p>

<p>"I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now. Mowgli,
    hast thou anything to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just."</p>

<p>Bagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther's point of view (they would hardly have waked one
  of his own cubs), but for a seven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could wish to avoid.
  When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself up without a word.</p>

<p>"Now," said Bagheera, "jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go home."</p>

<h3>One of the</h3>

<p>beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores. There is no nagging afterward.</p>

<p>Mowgli laid his head down on Bagheera's back and slept so deeply that he never
   waked when he was put down in the home-cave.</p>
